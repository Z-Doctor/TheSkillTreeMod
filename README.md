# Language Support

If you are interested in adding a translation, then follow these steps.

1. Download en_us.lang or and of the avaiable lang files.
2. Replace the text after each '=' on each line with your translation.
3. Rename the file <your-language>.lang
You can find the value for <your-language> [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language). Just make sure that the file name is in all lowercase.
4. Submit your file and it will be added to the game by me.

When you submit your translation, make sure to add your handle in the commit message so I can thank you and give you credit. If no name is provided, I will simply credit as Anonomyous until someone claims credit for it.
